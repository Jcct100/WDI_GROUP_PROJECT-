### Introduction:

For this project, I was working in a group of 4. We  are changing the way that people organise their night out. 

OutApp allows you to plan your night in advance: from creating an event that you can discuss with your friends to providing attendees with the ability to converse with one another in the build up to the event.


My role in the team mainly focused on writing tests and building the RESTful routes. I also pair programme on the Google API. I really enjoyed working in a team and putting the agile methodologies into practice.

### Our approach:

On the first day we brainstorm different ideas before choosing the best idea to work on. After we look at the different APIs available. We decided to use Google API because we wanted to add value to the users experiences. We wanted the user to see all the events organised by their friends on the map. The next day we drew wireframes on the whiteboard and discuss the functionalities, colours and themes of the website.  

We used Trello to organise our workload.  In Trello we added 5 different lists: BACKLOG, DEV IN PROGRESS, TESTING, DONE and BLOCKERS.  We created a card for each tasks and list them in the BACKLOG, when we start each task we move that card in to the DEV IN PROGRESS, once it’s done we move that to TESTING and then move that to DONE after we have wrote the test. Any tasks we are stuck on we move that to BLOCKERS. 

Throughout the project, every morning  we have daily stand ups to discuss  on what we have done and on any problems that is holding us back from achieving our goal, and we also discuss on what we are going to work on throughout the day. 

As a team we briefly discussed on the MVP. Our team strategy was to achieve the MVP as soon as possible and then we can have time to work on the nice to have features. There were some conflict in the team on agreeing on the MVP, but we manage to resolve quickly and move on to the next tasks as a team. We delegated tasks based on what we weren’t good at and as deadline approaching we gradually fall back into our own strength. 


### Technologies used:

* MEAN stack application with RESTful routes

* Get Skeleton

* SASS

* Google maps / places APIs

* Angular-momentjs 

* Filestack

* Instanbul for testing code coverage

* Mocha and Chai for tests

* Balsamic for wireframing

* Photoshop for UI design

* Trello for workflow

### What went well:

* We were very organized (mostly!)



* Initially we successfully planned the project well in Trello. As we got through the bulk of the tickets, we weren't as rigorous with creating new feature tickets



* We naturally ended up playing to each person's strengths as the deadline drew closer



* Pair programming: for the best part, we were more productive



* Design thinking- we learnt some tips and tricks on UI design, layout and styling from each other. E.g. cool sites for designing gradients, good resources for iconography.



### Rooms for improvement:

* We took the approach of getting things working basically and then iterating to embellish the product. This worked as a whole but it might have been better to implement the final model from the start rather than iterating on it.


* Lots of console errors remaining. Some are due to async nature of Google maps, some are lazy coding- missing closing tags in HTML etc. Unfortunately ran out of time so couldn't fix them.


* Communication. We communicated well when together but comms. took a hit when working from home. It wasn't always clear what everyone was working on.


* Git flow: on the whole our team did well with git flow but on occasion chevron's from the merge conflict message were left in by the person doing the merge which resulted in console errors. 


* Time management and common understanding of what is MVP. We didn't have a shared understanding of MVP which ultimately impacted priotisation of features.


* We ended up reaching MVP late on Thursday. 


* Do not leave merging everyone’s code to the day of the showcase!


### Feature backlog:

* Fixing bugs!
 

* Code refactoring and tidy up!


* Fixing styling!


* Finishing the ability for attendees to specify a location preference with the marker head changing to the avatar of the person that dropped the pin.


* Voting on location suggestions.


* integration with other APIs to get further information about a place to display in the info window.


* Ability for an event organiser to invite friends to an event + invite acceptance system.


* Attendee location awareness on the night.


* About page and tutorial for how to use the app the first time the users signs in.


* Facebook and Twitter integration – sharing plus authentication.


* Ability to create a photo album of snaps from the night.


* Tweak events index so it only displays events that you are interested in rather than all events.
